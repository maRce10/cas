`sketchy` is intended to facilitate the use of research compendiums for data analysis in the R environment. Standard research compendiums provide a easily recognizable means for organizing digital materials, allowing  other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and build upon that research.

Install/load the package from CRAN as follows:

```r

# From CRAN would be
#install.packages("cas")

#load package
library(sketchy)

```

To install the latest developmental version from [github](http://github.com/) you will need the R package [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools):

```r

# From github
devtools::install_github("maRce10/sketchy")

#load package
library(sketchy)

```
